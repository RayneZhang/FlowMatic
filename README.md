## Design Procedure
This section includes some design ideas and procedures. README is just a temporary location.

### Thoughts
- I think selection is an interesting problem here. There are currently three major ways to select a connector: 1. Raycast pointing selection; 2. Raycast cross selection (see: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3300848); 3. Touch based selection. It appears that the first way alone is not satisfying for FlowMatic. Perhaps we will add the third way into count.

### Type Visualization
11/12/2019 Visualizing types using primitive shapes (spheres, cones, cubes, and trapezium) and visualizing first-class abstractions (i.e. behaviors and events) using colors (red and green). This design makes it hard to diffrentiate types based on shapes as they appear similar when the colors are the same.
