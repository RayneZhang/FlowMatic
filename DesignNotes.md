# Design Procedure

## Type Visualization
11/12/2019 Visualizing types using primitive shapes (spheres, cones, cubes, and trapezium) and visualizing first-class abstractions (i.e. behaviors and events) using colors (red and green). This design makes it hard to diffrentiate types based on shapes as they appear similar when the colors are the same.
